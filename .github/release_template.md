# Checklist for creating a new release

- [ ] Update `CHANGELOG.md` for the new version
- [ ] Change version number in `pyintelowl/version.py`
- [ ] Verify CI Tests
- [ ] Merge the PR to the `master` branch. **Note:** Only use "Merge and commit" as the merge strategy and not "Squash and merge". Using "Squash and merge" makes history between branches misaligned.
