# Changelog

## [4.1.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/4.1.0)

> **This version supports only IntelOwl versions >=3.1.0.**

**Breaking Changes:**:

- Library: The `tags: List[int]` argument has been deprecated in favor of `tags_labels: List[str]` in the methods, `IntelOwl.send_observable_analysis_request` and `IntelOwl.send_file_analysis_request`. Previously, the `tags` argument would accept a list of tag indices, now the `tags_labels` accepts a list of tag labels (non-existing `Tag` objects are created automatically with a randomly generated color).
- CLI: Due to above change the `-tl/--tags-list` flag in `analyse` now also accepts a list of tag labels.

**Others:**

- Bump dependencies. `click` -> 8.0.1, `rich` -> 10.12, `click-creds` -> 0.0.3.

## [4.0.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/4.0.0)

> **This version supports only IntelOwl versions >=3.0.0 and includes many breaking changes.**

**Changes:**

- Refactored argument names and ordering for `ask_analysis_availability`, `send_file_analysis_request`, `send_observable_analysis_request` methods to comply with latest changes in IntelOwl's REST API.
- Deprecate `run_all_available_analyzers` argument/flag.

**New Features:**

- Ability to specify `connectors_requested` when creating a new analysis.
- Ability to request and view "Connector Reports" for a job.
- Ability to request `connector_config.json` file and view in either JSON or tabular format.
- Ability to request download of sample associated with a job.
- Added `kill`, `retry` and `healthcheck` features to analyzers and connectors. See [Managing Analyzers and Connectors](https://intelowl.readthedocs.io/en/master/Usage.html#managing-analyzers-and-connectors) section of the documentation.

**Others:**

- Soften peer dependencies/requirements to avoid pip conflicts.
- Better testing across different python versions using tox's matrix.

## [3.0.1](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/3.0.1)

This release was created mainly to solve a problem with the installation of the pip package.

Other changes:

- added support for adding tags when requesting a new job
- added support for creating/editing tags
- added support for "generic" classification of observables

## [3.0.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/3.0.0)

_Note: Incompatible with previous versions_

This version brings a complete rewrite of the pyintelowl library as well as command line client. We very much recommend you to update to the latest version to enjoy all new features.

- The new CLI is written with [pallets/click](https://github.com/pallets/click) and supports all IntelOwl API endpoints. The CLI is well-documented and will help you navigate different commands; you can use it to request new analysis, view an old analysis, view `analyzer_config.json`, view list of tags, list of jobs, etc.
- Complete type-hinting and sphinx docs for the `pyintelowl.IntelOwl` class with helper member functions for each IntelOwl API endpoint.

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/2.0.0)

**This version supports only IntelOwl versions >=1.8.0 (about to be released). To interact with previous IntelOwl versions programmatically please refer to pyintelowl version 1.3.5**

- we forced [black](https://github.com/psf/black) style, added linters and precommit configuration. In this way pyintelowl is aligned to IntelOwl.
- we have updated the authentication method from a JWT Token to a simple Token. In this way, it is easier to use pyintelowl for integrations with other products and there are no more concurrency problems on multiple simultaneous requests.

If you were using pyintelowl and IntelOwl before this version, you have to:

- update IntelOwl to version>=1.8.0
- retrieve a new API token from the Django Admin Interface for your user: you have to go in the _Durin_ section (click on `Auth tokens`) and generate a key there. This token is valid until manually deleted.

## [1.3.5](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/1.3.5)

Now optional parameter "runtime_configuration" properly works

Please use this version of pyintelowl with version >= 1.5.x of IntelOwl

## [1.3.4](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/1.3.4)

see [1.3.3](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/1.3.3) for details

## [1.3.3](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/1.3.3)

Some fixes:

- pyintelowl did not work correctly against HTTPS-enabled IntelOwl Servers
- fixed parameter name in send_observable_analysis_request

Please use this version of pyintelowl with v1.5.x of IntelOwl

## [1.3.2](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/1.3.2)

## [1.1.0](https://github.com/intelowlproject/pyintelowl/releases/tag/1.1.0)

Added an option when executing pyintelowl as CLI: `-sc` will show the results in a colorful and organized way that helps the user in looking for useful information. By default, the results are still shown in the JSON format. Thanks to tsale to his idea and contribution.

**Example:**

```
python3 intel_owl_client.py -i <your_intelowl_instance> -sc -a VirusTotal_v2_Get_Observable -a HybridAnalysis_Get_Observable -a OTXQuery observable -v www.google.com
```
